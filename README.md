## Powering Up ⚡️
PowerUp utilizes the [RAWG](https://rawg.io) API to retrieve game information, ensuring you have access to a vast database.  

Behind the scenes, a dedicated [backend](https://github.com/C043/PowerUp-backend) handles user authentication, your gaming lists, and all your valuable rating data. 

**P.S.** Feedback and suggestions are always welcome! Feel free to reach out.
